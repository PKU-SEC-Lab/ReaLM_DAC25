Document:Antibiotics are a type of medication used to treat bacterial infections. They work by either killing the bacteria or preventing them from reproducing, allowing the body’s immune system to fight off the infection. Antibiotics are usually taken orally in the form of pills, capsules, or liquid solutions, or sometimes administered intravenously. They are not effective against viral infections, and using them inappropriately can lead to antibiotic resistance.

Document: A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel. As they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames. One of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland. The driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed. Both groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned. Police have appealed for information about the attack. Insp David Gibson said: "It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second. "While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately."

Document: The 22-year-old midfielder, from Glasgow, was stopped by police for driving erratically in the Robroyston area at about 03:00 on 5 February. Officers asked him to provide a breath test and he gave an alcohol reading of 78mg - the legal limit is 22. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, McGregor was also fined Â£500. Sheriff Neil Mackinnon disqualified McGregor for 12 months, although he may get a reduction if he successfully completes a drink driving course. Last August, McGregor was banned from driving for four months and fined Â£400 after being caught driving at 69mph in a 50mph zone. The court opted to impose a four-month ban instead of a heavier penalty and left him with nine points on his licence. He was convicted at Hamilton Justice of the Peace Court after claiming the speed gun was faulty. McGregor began as a youth player at Celtic and spent a year on loan at English side Notts County in the 2013-14 season. He returned to Celtic and scored in his first-team debut against KR Reykjavik in a Champions League qualifier in 2014.

Document: Peter Whittle said he would back Paul Nuttall as "a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty" of all members. Former deputy leader Mr Nuttall, former deputy chairwoman Suzanne Evans and ex- soldier John Rees-Evans remain in the contest, to be decided on 28 November. Raheem Kassam also withdrew from the contest on Monday. In a message on Facebook, Mr Whittle said Thursday's High Court ruling, which found that the government could not trigger Article 50 - the formal process of leaving the EU - without consulting Parliament, showed that "the battle to ensure that the Leave vote in the referendum is respected is far from over and UKIP is needed more than ever". Mr Whittle, the party's culture spokesman and a former London mayoral candidate, added that the "sheer breadth of Paul's political experience, his dedication to the values of the party and the obvious affection in which he is held by members make him the person who is best placed to take us forward". Nigel Farage is back as interim leader after his successor Diane James quit just 18 days into the job. Mr Kassam, a former aide to Mr Farage, had endorsed Mr Whittle after himself pulling out of the race.

Honduran President Porfirio Lobo has ordered a safety review of all prisons as experts try to establish the causes of the blaze in the Comayagua prison.

The other was the wife of a prisoner who had come to visit her husband. Forensic experts from Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico have joined their Honduran colleagues to try to speed up the identification process. The United States has sent a team from its Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to help with the investigation into the causes of the fire. ATF team member Jose Oquendo said they would stay "until the investigation is concluded, however long that may take". The Honduran Ministry of Public Affairs said there had been 852 people inside the prison when the fire broke out on Tuesday.
